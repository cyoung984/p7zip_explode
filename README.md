p7zip_explode
=============

Modified version of p7zip which supports archive exploding, that is, creating a new 7z archive for each of an archives blocks.

Use command line p for exPloding.

Creates an archive falled <archivename>.7z_folder<x>.7z for each folder, ie hello.7z_folder0.7z. Doesn't create any directories for them yet though.
